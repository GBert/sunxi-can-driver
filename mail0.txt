Subject: [PATCH v5 0/2] can: Allwinner A10/A20 CAN Controller support - summary

Hi,

please find attached the next try. Thanks to Marc. I've worked on all mentioned
issues except one: I don't add clk_disable_unprepare in sunxi_can_start. Makes no
sense to me (driver fails).

For testers:
the patch will only apply wihtout modification to kernels 3.19+.
I've tested the driver (receipt, sending and basic errors). IMHO
everything is fine. The performance seems to be good - high rates
(>5000 packets/second) working fine.

Please test and report bugs if exists.


[PATCH v5 1/2] Device Tree Binding Documentation
[PATCH v5 2/2] Kernel Module

History:
    V5: fix license
        modify prefix to mode select defines
        enable and disable clock in sunxican_get_berr_counter
	delete set_normal_mode at the end of sunxi_can_start
	removed sunxican_id_table
	use devm_clk_get instead of clk_get
	use devm_ioremap_resource to simplify probe and remove
	make set-normal-mode and set-reset-mode more readable
        
    v4: defines prefixed with SUNXI_
        sunxi_can_write_cmdreg tweaked
	loops in set_xxx_mode reworked
	add return value to set_xxx_mode
	sunxican_start_xmit reworked
	struct platform_driver stripped
	moved set_bittiming into open
	moved clock start into open
	add clock stop to close
        suspend reworked
        resume reworked
        fixed double counting bug

    v3: changed error state change handling (thx Andri for the hint)
        use bittiming function correct (no need to call it)
        strip down priv (suggested by Marc)
        scripts/checkpatch.pl-> no matches anymore
        sparse -> no errors or warnings anymore
    v2: cleaning
    v1: initial
