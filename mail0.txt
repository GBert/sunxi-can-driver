Subject: [PATCH v4 0/2] can: Allwinner A10/A20 CAN Controller support - summary

Hi,

please find attached the next try. Thanks to Marc; AFAIK I have
worked on all mentioned issues.

[PATCH v4 1/2] Device Tree Binding Documentation
[PATCH v4 2/2] Kernel Module

History:
    v4: defines prefixed with SUNXI_
        sunxi_can_write_cmdreg tweaked
	loops in set_xxx_mode reworked
	add return value to set_xxx_mode
	sunxican_start_xmit reworked
	struct platform_driver stripped
	moved set_bittiming into open
	moved clock start into open
	add clock stop to close
        suspend reworked
        resume reworked
        fixed double counting bug

    v3: changed error state change handling (thx Andri for the hint)
        use bittiming function correct (no need to call it)
        strip down priv (suggested by Marc)
        scripts/checkpatch.pl-> no matches anymore
        sparse -> no errors or warnings anymore
    v2: cleaning
    v1: initial
